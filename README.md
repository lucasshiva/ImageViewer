# Image Viewer

A simple image viewer built in Python 3 using the Qt framework.

# Usage

First, clone it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lucasshiva/ImageViewer.git
```

Go inside the project folder

```sh
cd ImageViewer/
```

Now, inside the project folder, install it in editable mode.
You can do this in two ways:

```sh
# Using poetry
poetry install

# Using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt -e
```

- Note: Make sure your pip is updated. Run `pip install --upgrade pip`.

Then, still inside the project folder, run `python imageviewer/app.py`.
